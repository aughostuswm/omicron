 * request handler that's serializing a stream of API objects.  In particular,
 * if the `Result` is actually an error, that object is simply skipped, as
 * we can't fail the HTTP request in this case.  See comments below for details.
 *
 * This function currently always serializes to JSON.  If it becomes important
 * to support other formats (e.g., XML), this function could accept some context
 * associated with the HTTP request (or response) to indicate what format to use
 * and then use the right one.

     * This function is invoked for each item in a stream.  Each item is a
     * Result.  In the simple case of an ok result, we serialize the object via
     * serde and return the resulting bytes.  But what if we have an error?
     * This function is generally used in a context in which we're sending a
     * streaming HTTP response body to a client.  Critically, we've already
     * emitted a successful HTTP status code.  We have no good way to provide
     * the client with an error.  The only thing we could do is terminate the
     * response prematurely.  Indeed, if we were to emit an Err from this
     * function, Actix _will_ terminate the response.  A careful client will
     * know that something bad happened (because the content-length or chunk
     * lengths will not match what's expected) and will likely throw out the
     * whole response.  A less careful client may not realize that its response
     * was truncated and believe it has all of the data.  Either way, this isn't
     * a great situation.
     *
     * How could we get here?  This could happen if, for example, we were
     * streaming rows back from a database and one of the rows didn't pass a
     * validation check.  For now, we make the executive decision to simply skip
     * this item.  This isn't great, but again, it's not clear what a better
     * option is here.  At the very least, we ought to bump a counter and log a
     * warning (potentially throttled to avoid spamming our logs if we keep
     * hitting the same bad object).  None of this infrastructure exists yet.
     * TODO Make sure to add counters and log messages for this case.
     *
     * Note: one alternative would be to abandon streaming APIs altogether in
     * favor of bounded-size responses with pagination.  After all, we already
     * apply tight bounds to responses and support pagination.  If we buffer
     * everything up ahead of time, then we could potentially send a proper
     * error response for this case.  But this doesn't really solve the problem,
     * since we still have to decide whether to omit the problematic item or
     * fail the request.  And streaming responses is still useful for memory
     * usage and liveness.  So we settle for this approach.

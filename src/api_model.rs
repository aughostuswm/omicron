/**
 * ApiObject is a trait implemented by the types used to represent objects in
 * the API.  It's helpful to start with a concrete example, so let's consider
 * a Project, which is about as simple a resource as we have.
 *
 * The `ApiProject` struct represents a project as understood by the API.  It
 * contains all the fields necessary to implement a Project.  It has several
 * associated types:
 *
 * * `ApiProjectView`, which is what gets emitted by the API when a user asks
 *    for a Project
 * * `ApiProjectCreateParams`, which is what must be provided to the API when a
 *   user wants to create a new project
 * * `ApiProjectUpdate`, which is what must be provided to the API when a user
 *   wants to update a project.
 *
 * Recall that we intend to support two backends: one backed by a real Oxide
 * rack and the other backed by a simulator.  The interfaces to these backends
 * is defined by the `ApiBackend` trait, which provides functions for operating
 * on resources like projects.  For example, `ApiBackend` provides
 * `project_lookup(primary key)`,
 * `project_list(marker: Option, limit: usize)`,
 * `project_create(project, ApiProjectCreateParams)`,
 * `project_update(project, ApiProjectUpdateParams)`, and
 * `project_delete(project)`.  These are all `async` functions.
 *
 * We expect to add many more types to the API for things like instances, disks,
 * images, networking abstractions, organizations, teams, users, system
 * components, and the like.  See RFD 4 for details.  The current plan is to add
 * types and supporting backend functions for each of these resources.  However,
 * different types may support different operations.  For examples, instances
 * will have additional operations (like "boot" and "halt").  System component
 * resources may be immutable (i.e., they won't define a "CreateParams" type, an
 * "UpdateParams" type, nor create or update functions on the Backend).
 *
 * The only thing guaranteed by the `ApiObject` trait is that the type can be
 * converted to a View, which is something that can be serialized.

= Oxide API Prototype

This repo houses a prototype for the Oxide Rack API.  See:

* https://github.com/oxidecomputer/rfd/tree/master/rfd/0004[RFD 4 User Facing API Design]
* https://github.com/oxidecomputer/rfd/tree/master/rfd/0010[RFD 10 API Prototype and Simulated Implementation]

== Status

The code here is very rough at this point.

There are a couple of somewhat independent efforts, in no particular order:

* API server guts: work out the shape of the HTTP and API layers.  (See
  DESIGN.md.)
* OpenAPI integration.  See RFD 10 for notes on this.  Figure out the approach
  and implement it (e.g., decide that the server code is the source of truth,
  define some syntax for noting that in code, and then implement a tool to
  process this and produce an OpenAPI spec file).
* Rest of the server: logging, tracing, error handling, etc. that we want.

See <<_todo>> for more info.

== Build and run

The server requires a configuration file to run.  You can use
`examples/config.toml` to start with.  Build and run the server:

[source,text]
----
$ cargo run -- examples/config.toml
...
listening: http://127.0.0.1:12220
----

Use `curl` to hit the server:

[source,text]
----
$ curl -i http://127.0.0.1:12220/projects
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
content-type: application/x-ndjson
x-request-id: f5b58969-2df8-4bd9-8fef-8e42a6c02d69

{"id":"simproject2","name":"simproject2","description":"<auto-generated at server startup>"}
{"id":"simproject3","name":"simproject3","description":"<auto-generated at server startup>"}
----

You can run the tests with `cargo test`.  The test suite runs cleanly and should
remain clean.

== Configuration

The server requires a TOML configuration file.  There's an example in
`examples/config.toml`:

[source,toml]
----
include::examples/config.toml[]
----

Supported config properties include:

[cols="4",options="header"]
|===
|Name
|Example
|Required?
|Description

|`bind_address`
|`"127.0.0.1:12220"`
|Yes
|Specifies that the server should bind to the given IP address and TCP port.  In
general, servers can bind to more than one IP address and port, but this is not
(yet?) supported.

== TODO

* Currently adding logging
** add support for config file -- setting stdout or file (bunyan) output
*** file output should be bunyan instead of what it is now
*** add level to config file
** figure out why logs are coming out of the test suite -- aren't they supposed to be captured?
** add support for LOG_LEVEL override
** then change one message to `trace!` (see XXX)
** add tests for all of this
* Flesh out more endpoints and simulator
* Write out road map
** regions, AZs, etc. need to be added per RFD 24
* General work:
** OpenAPI support
*** Rust macros
*** Tooling to generate spec - API Docs
*** Client library/libraries and CLI
** Debugging / monitoring
*** Prometheus?
*** Server / request logging
*** OpenTracing?  OpenTelemetry?
*** Dynamic tracing?
*** Core files?
*** Internal APIs for:
**** showing connected clients, recent requests, ...?
** Rack-Internal API?
*** Alerts?
*** Faults?  Support bundles?
** Audit logging
** Authentication
** Authorization
** Data storage
*** What's the scope of these servers?
*** CAP choices
*** Active/Active, Active/Passive, Consensus?
** TLS
** Versioning (header? path? translators for older versions?)
** Pagination? (Opaque token?  What does Stripe do?)
** Hardening (see RFD 10)
*** throttling / load shedding
** Automated testing
*** Basic functionality
*** Performance testing
*** Stress testing
*** Fault testing / under load
*** Fuzz testing
** Security review

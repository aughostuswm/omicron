= Oxide API Prototype

This repo houses a prototype for the Oxide Rack API.  See:

* https://github.com/oxidecomputer/rfd/tree/master/rfd/0004[RFD 4 User Facing API Design]
* https://github.com/oxidecomputer/rfd/tree/master/rfd/0010[RFD 10 API Prototype and Simulated Implementation]

== Status

The code here is very rough at this point.

There are a couple of somewhat independent efforts, in no particular order:

* API server guts: work out the shape of the HTTP and API layers.  (See
  DESIGN.md.)
* OpenAPI integration.  See RFD 10 for notes on this.  Figure out the approach
  and implement it (e.g., decide that the server code is the source of truth,
  define some syntax for noting that in code, and then implement a tool to
  process this and produce an OpenAPI spec file).
* Rest of the server: logging, tracing, error handling, etc. that we want.

See <<_todo>> for more info.

== Build and run

The server requires a configuration file to run.  You can use
`examples/config.toml` to start with.  Build and run the server:

[source,text]
----
$ cargo run -- examples/config.toml
...
listening: http://127.0.0.1:12220
----

Use `curl` to hit the server:

[source,text]
----
$ curl -i http://localhost:12220/projects
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
content-type: application/x-ndjson
x-request-id: 980984b3-60b8-4319-ae5a-a06f79529ee0

----

You can run the tests with `cargo test`.  The test suite runs cleanly and should
remain clean.

== Configuration

The server requires a TOML configuration file.  There's an example in
`examples/config.toml`:

[source,toml]
----
include::examples/config.toml[]
----

Supported config properties include:

[cols="4",options="header"]
|===
|Name
|Example
|Required?
|Description

|`dropshot.bind_address`
|`"127.0.0.1:12220"`
|Yes
|Specifies that the server should bind to the given IP address and TCP port.  In
general, servers can bind to more than one IP address and port, but this is not
(yet?) supported.

|`log.mode`
|`"file"`
|Yes
|Controls where server logging will go.  Valid modes are `"stderr-terminal"` and
`"file".  If the mode is `"stderr-terminal"`, human-readable output, with colors
and other terminal formatting if possible, will be sent to stderr.  If the mode
is `"file"`, Bunyan-format output will be sent to the filesystem path given by
`log.path`.  See also `log.if_exists`, which controls the behavior if the
destination path already exists.

|`log.level`
|`"info"`
|Yes
|Specifies what severity of log messages should be included in the log.  Valid
values include `"trace"`, `"debug"`, `"info"`, `"warn"`, `"error"`, and
`"critical"`, which are increasing order of severity.  Log messages at the
specified level and more severe levels will be included in the log.

|`log.path`
|`"logs/server.log"`
|Only if `log.mode = "file"`
|If `log.mode` is `"file"`, this property determines the path to the log file.
See also `log.if_exists`.

|`log.if_exists`
|`"append"`
|Only if `log.mode = "file"`
|If `log.mode` is `"file"`, this property specifies what to do if the
destination log file already exists.  Valid values include `"append"` (which
appends to the existing file), `"truncate"` (which truncates the existing file
and then uses it as though it had just been created), and `"fail"` (which causes
the server to exit immediately with an error).

== TODO

* Current work: adding support for Instances
** Working on instances
*** finish writing tests in test_basic.rs
*** Delete
*** Update?
*** Build infrastructure for supporting async operations (boot, halt, reboot),
    checking on status, etc.
** Other thoughts:
*** separate out api_model_data.rs from api_model_backend.rs?
*** Instead of having this totally agnostic backend, would it make sense to
    instead have a model layer that knows exactly what _storage_ backend it's
    using but has a Rack backend that's all timeouts and noops?
* Repo cleanup
** incorporate openapi directly into this subcrate
** rename "lib" to something else (e.g., "local_deps")
** Dropshot itself should be documented
* Flesh out more endpoints and simulator
* Write out road map
** regions, AZs, etc. need to be added per RFD 24
* General work:
** OpenAPI support: Rust macros, tooling to generate spec, client librar(ies),
   CLI
** Debugging / monitoring
*** Prometheus?
*** OpenTracing?  OpenTelemetry?
*** Dynamic tracing?
*** Core files?
*** Internal APIs for:
**** showing connected clients, recent requests, ...?
** Rack-Internal API?
*** Alerts?
*** Faults?  Support bundles?
** Audit logging
** Authentication
** Authorization
** Data storage
*** What's the scope of these servers?
*** CAP choices
*** Active/Active, Active/Passive, Consensus?
** TLS
** Versioning (header? path? translators for older versions?)
** Pagination? (Opaque token?  What does Stripe do?)
** Hardening (see RFD 10)
*** throttling / load shedding
** Automated testing
*** General API testing: there's a lot of boilerplate in hand-generated tests
    for each kind of resource.  Would it be reasonable / possible to have a sort
    of omnibus test that's given the OpenAPI spec (or something like it),
    creates a hierarchy with at least one of every possible resource, and does
    things like: For each possible resource
**** attempt to (create, get, put, delete) one with an invalid name
**** attempt to (GET, DELETE, PUT) one that does not exist
**** attempt to create one with invalid JSON
**** attempt to create one with a duplicate name of the one we know about
**** exercise list operation with marker and limit (may need to create many of them)
**** for each required input property:
***** attempt to create a resource without that property
**** for each input property: attempt to create a resource with invalid values
     for that property
**** list instances of that resource and expect to find the one we know about
**** GET the one instance we know about
**** DELETE the one instance we know about
**** GET the one instance we know about again and expect it to fail
**** list instances again and expect to find nothing
*** Basic functionality
*** Performance testing
*** Stress testing
*** Fault testing / under load
*** Fuzz testing
** Security review

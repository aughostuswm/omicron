  actions: FetchPolicy, ListSagas, ListSleds, ListRacks, ListBuiltinUsers, ListBuiltinRoles, ListSilos, CreateSilo
  note:    Fleet-level roles apply to everything in the system.  However, even fleet admins have no way to refer to resources in Silos other than the ones they exist in.  This test creates fleet admins in Silo "s1".
